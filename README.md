```

## ðŸ‘¾ Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.css
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Tailwind looks for `.html` or `.js` files in the `src/pages/` directory.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ¤– Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command       | Action                                             |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install` | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev` | Compiles Tailwind CSS based on input file changes. |

> [!NOTE]
> To start the development server, you can use any live server extension in your preferred code editor, such as Live Server in VS Code or Live Preview.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> this command: `npm run dev`
> Generates the appropriate CSS for the project and watches for changes in the input file (input.css) located in the src/ directory. The compiled CSS is then outputted to the output.css file in the dist/ directory. This command is essential for working with Tailwind CSS, ensuring that your styles are compiled correctly as you make changes to your project.
